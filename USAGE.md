# How to Use Slack with Claude

This guide shows you exactly what to say to Claude to use Slack features.

## What You Can Do

After setup, you can ask Claude to:
- Read your unread Slack messages
- Send messages to any channel or person
- List all your channels and direct messages
- Get information about people in your workspace

## Getting Started

### 1. Reading Your Messages

**Simple requests you can make:**

- *"Show me my unread Slack messages"*
- *"What's new in Slack?"*
- *"Check for any unread messages in my work Slack"*
- *"Read my latest Slack notifications"*

### 2. Sending Messages

**To send to a channel:**
- *"Send a message to #general saying 'Good morning team!'"*
- *"Post in #marketing channel: 'The campaign is ready for review'"*

**To send direct messages:**
- *"Send a DM to John saying 'Can we chat about the project?'"*
- *"Message Sarah: 'Thanks for your help today!'"*

**To reply in a thread:**
- *"Reply to that message thread in #general with 'I agree with this approach'"*

### 3. Finding Channels and People

**See what's available:**
- *"List all my Slack channels"*
- *"Show me all the people in my workspace"*
- *"What channels am I part of?"*

**Get specific information:**
- *"Tell me about the user John Smith"*
- *"Show me recent messages from #dev-team channel"*

### 4. Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple Slack workspaces (like work and personal), you can connect them all:

- *"List all my connected Slack workspaces"*
- *"Show unread messages from my personal Slack"*
- *"Connect my other Slack workspace"* (Claude will guide you through setup)

## Real-World Examples

### Daily Work Assistant
- *"Claude, check my work Slack and summarize what I missed overnight"*
- *"Send a good morning message to my team in #general"*
- *"Post my daily standup update: 'Working on the client presentation today'"*

### Quick Communication
- *"Tell the marketing team in #marketing that the designs are ready"*
- *"Let John know I'll be 5 minutes late to our meeting"*
- *"Ask in #dev-team if anyone has experience with React hooks"*

### Stay Updated
- *"What's happening in our #project-alpha channel?"*
- *"Show me the latest messages from my boss Sarah"*
- *"Check if there are any urgent messages I need to respond to"*

## Common Questions

**Q: How does Claude know which channel to send to?**
A: Just mention the channel name like "#general" or the person's name like "John". Claude will find the right one.

**Q: Can people tell it's automated?**
A: No! Messages appear exactly as if you typed them yourself.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: You can edit or delete messages in Slack normally, just like any message you send.

**Q: Can Claude read private channels?**
A: Only channels you have access to. Claude uses your permissions.

## Need Help?

If something isn't working:

1. **Try saying**: *"Claude, list my Slack workspaces"* to check if you're connected
2. **Check your setup**: Make sure you followed all steps in the README
3. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Sometimes this fixes connection issues
4. **Check the error**: Claude will usually tell you what went wrong

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: *"Send to #marketing"* is better than *"send to marketing"*
- **Use quotes**: *"Send this message: 'Hello team'"* for exact text
- **Ask for confirmation**: *"Before sending, show me what you'll post"*
